## Profile & Research

Interested in research at the intersection of Cognitive Science, Social Networks, Bayesian Statistics and Complexity Science. I have a solid theoretical and statistical background and interest. I also have strong coding skills in R, Python and bash scripting. I have conducted research on the Science of Science & COVID using network science methodology with Roberta Sinatra (NERDS, ITU), and have used Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to understand scientific discovery and diversity with Riccardo Fusaroli (AU). Currently writing my Master's thesis at the Cognitive Science MSc programme at Aarhus University (AU) supervised by Riccardo Fusaroli. The thesis uses Bayesian statistical modeling, network science and NLP to understand the reform movement in psychology. 

## Education

`2020-current`
__Cognitive Science MSc, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
Including internship at the NEtwoRks, Data, and Society (NERDS) research group at the IT-University of Copenhagen (ITU) working on science of science. In general focusing on Bayesian statistics, network science and NLP. 

`2017-2020`
__Cognitive Science BSc, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
Including elective in mathematics at AU. The bachelor project was an Agent-Based Model (ABM) extending on "Scientific discovery in a model-centric framework: Reproducibility, innovation, and epistemic diversity" by Devezer et al. (2019). Learning statistics, social and cultural dynamics, cognition and language. 

## Job Experience 

`2020-current`
__Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA)__ <br/>
Currently working for the Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA) as a
student programmer. Mainly natural language processing (NLP) and social
networks (e.g. Twitter, Reddit, 4chan). Currently working with researchers to
understand Chinese diplomats and state media on Twitter, see
[Github](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/china-twitter).

`2019-2020`
__Research Assistant at Music in the Brain (MiB)__ <br/>
Research assistant on a large-scale neuroimaging- and behavioural study on
structural and functional changes in the brains of first-time parents. Learned
to scan using fMRI, MEG and to conduct behavioural testing and data analysis.

`2018-2020`
__Teaching Assistant (TA) at Cognitive Science BSc__ <br/>
Teaching assistant (TA) for Studium Generale (2018) covering history and philosophy
of science (with a focus on psychology and philosophy of mind). TA for Experimental Methods 3 (2020)
covering frequentist multilevel modeling. TA for Computational Modeling of
Cognitive Science (2020) covering Bayesian modeling (following McElreath's
'Statistical Rethinking').
