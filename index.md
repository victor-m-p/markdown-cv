## Profile & Research

Interested in research at the intersection of Cognitive Science, Social Networks, Bayesian Statistics and Complexity Science. I have a solid theoretical and statistical understanding and strong coding skills in R, Python and bash scripting. I have conducted research on the Science of Science & COVID using network science methodology with Roberta Sinatra (NERDS, ITU), and have used Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to understand scientific discovery and diversity with Riccardo Fusaroli (AU). Currently writing my Master's thesis at the Cognitive Science MSc programme at Aarhus University (AU) supervised by Riccardo Fusaroli. The thesis uses Bayesian statistical modeling, network science and NLP to understand the reform movement in psychology. 

## Education

`2020-current`
__Cognitive Science MSc, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
Including internship at the NEtwoRks, Data, and Society (NERDS) research group at the IT-University of Copenhagen (ITU) working on science of science. In general focusing on Bayesian statistics, network science and NLP. 

`2017-2020`
__Cognitive Science BSc, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
Including elective in mathematics at AU. The bachelor project was an Agent-Based Model (ABM) extending on "Scientific discovery in a model-centric framework: Reproducibility, innovation, and epistemic diversity" by Devezer et al. (2019). Learning statistics, social and cultural dynamics, cognition and language. 

## Job Experience 

`2020-current`
__Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA)__ <br/>
Currently working for the Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA) as a
student programmer. CHCAA is a computational research laboratory at Aarhus University (AU).
As a student programmer I develop research projects with researchers from the humanities,
and conduct analyses. My projects have mainly used natural language processing (NLP)
and social network analysis (e.g. Twitter, Reddit, 4chan). Currently working with researchers
to understand Chinese diplomats and state media on Twitter, see
[Github](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/china-twitter).

`2018-2020`
__Teaching Assistant (TA) at Cognitive Science BSc__ <br/>
Teaching assistant (TA) for Riccardo Fusaroli on  the course "Computational Modeling of Cognitive Science" (2020)
covering advanced Bayesian modeling. TA for Riccardo Fusaroli on the course "Experimental Methods 3" (2020) covering
multilevel modeling and machine learning (ML). TA for Savhannah Schulz on the course "Studium Generale" (2018) covering
history and philosophy of science with a focus on cognitive science.

`2019-2020`
__Research Assistant at Music in the Brain (MiB)__ <br/>
Research assistant on a large-scale neuroimaging- and behavioural study focusing on the
structural and functional changes in the brains of first-time parents. Conducted fMRI and MEG 
imaging on participants, as well as behavioural testing, data analysis, planning and recruiting.
