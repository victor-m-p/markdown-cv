## Profile & Research
I am broadly interseted in complexity science research, including social networks, cognitive science, and bayesian statistics. I am excited about diving into various fields and questions, and applying cutting-edge computational and statistical models to understand complex phenomena. I have worked on various approaches to statistical and computational modeling of social, cultural, and cognitive data. The work has included various methodologies, ranging from Agent-Based Models (ABMs) (e.g., Bachelor's thesis), to Bayesian modeling, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) (e.g., Master's thesis), and large-scale network analysis (e.g., internship with prof. Roberta Sinatra). Currently, I am working as a predoctoral fellow with prof. Simon DeDeo (CMU/SFI) on novel Machine Learning (ML) approaches to social and cultural data in the "small data" limit. 

## Education

`2020-2022`
__Cognitive Science MSc, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
In the 2020-2022 period I obtained a Cognitive Science (MSc) degree from Aarhus University (AU). My Master's thesis "The Social Dynamics of Reform" focused on understanding the social dynamics of the replication crisis in psychological science, and the reform movement which followed. The thesis used advanced Bayesian statistics to model citations for replication articles, and used NLP and social network analysis methods to understand the topics of contention, and the social dynamics of the reform movement. As part of my Master's studies I did an internship with prof. Roberta Sinatra at the NEtworKs, Data, and Society (NERDS) research group at the IT-University of Copenhagen (ITU). The work focused on the impact of COVID-19 on scientific publishing, in particular my work focused on changes in the collaboration network centrality of various groups. 

`2017-2020`
__Cognitive Science BSc, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
In the 2017-2020 period I obtained a Cognitive Science (BSc) degree from Aarhus University (AU). My Bachelor's thesis was a an attempt to extend a previously published ABM by Devezer et al. (2019). The project investigated how agents pursuing various research strategies and interact can reliably explore a hypothesis space, the role of diversity, and network connectivity. As part of my Bachelor's studies I took electives at the mathematics department at Aarhus University (AU) to strenghten my quantitative profile. 

## Job Experience 

`2022-current` 
__Predoctoral Fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University (Simon DeDeo)__ <br/>
I am currently working with prof. Simon DeDeo (CMU/SFI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as a predoctoral researcher. Our research focuses on applying models from statistical physics (e.g. the Ising model) to develop novel Machine Learning (ML) approaches to social and cultural data. In particular, we have focused on improving existing methods to make better inferences from small-scale data sets which are subject to biases, inconsistencies, and missing data. Through my position, I have been able to interact with world-class researchers in complexity science, and have I have presented our work to research groups at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI). 

`2020-2022`
__Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA)__ <br/>
In the 2020-2022 period I worked as a student programmer at the Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA). The job involved collaborating with researchers from the humanities to develop analysis pipelines. Most of the projects involved NLP and social network analysis (e.g., on data from Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan). A major project involved analyzing the increasing presence of Chinese diplomats and state media on Twitter (https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/china-twitter).

`2019-2020`
__Research Assistant at Music in the Brain (MiB)__ <br/>
In the 2019-2020 period, I worked as a research assistant on a large-scale neuroimaging- and behavioural study focusing on the structural and functional changes in the brains of first-time parents. I conducted fMRI and MEG imaging on participants, as well as behavioural testing, data analysis, planning, and recruiting. 

## Technical Skills and Languages
* Danish, and English (excellent)
* Python, R, LaTeX, and GitHub (excellent) 
* Julia, Bash, and Inkscape (decent)

## Teaching Experience
`2020`
__Teaching Assistant for "Computational Modeling of Cognitive Science"__ <br/>
I was a teaching assistent for prof. Riccardo Fusaroli on the course "Computational Modeling of Cognitive Science" in 2020 (fall semester). The course is taught for students at the Cognitive Science (BSc) program at Aarhus University. The focus of the course is on applied Bayesian statistics in the R programming language. The course focuses on practical modeling skills (e.g., multilevel modeling, MCMC sampling, etc.) but also touches on broader topics, such as entropy, and causality (e.g. Directed Acyclic Grahps). In this course I mainly helped the students with conceptual and technical questions related to weekly exercises. 

`2020`
__Teaching Assistant for "Experimental Methods 3"__ <br/>
I was a teaching assistant for prof. Byurakn Ishkhanyan on the course "Experimental Methods 3" in 2020 (spring semester). The course is taught for students at the Cognitive Science (BSc) program at Aarhus University. The course focuses on advanced frequentist statistics and Machine Learning (ML) in the R programming language. In this course I prepared presentations for class exercises, and helped students with both conceptual and technical questions related to weekly exercises. 

`2018`
__Teaching Assistant for "Studium Generale"__ <br/>
I was a teaching assistant for Savhannah Schulz on the course "Studium Generale" in 2018. The course is taught for students at the Cognitive Science (BSc) program at Aarhus University. The course focuses on the history of Cognitive Science as a discipline, and philosophy of science more broadly. The course covers how various disciplines contribute conceptually and methodologically to work in Cognitive Science, and how we define a scientific discipline and research program (incl. Popper, Lakatos, Kuhn, etc.). In this course I prepared presentations, and facilitated discussions, exercises, and formal debates. 

## Publications

`2023` 
__Poulsen, V. M., & DeDeo, S. (2023). Inferring Cultural Landscapes with the Inverse Ising Model. Entropy, 25(2), 264.__ <br/> 
The article presents extensions and improvements to the Minimum Probability Flow (MPF) algorithm to approximate the inverse Ising model, and features a case-study on the Database of Religious History (DRH). 

__Cognitive Attractors and the Cultural Evolution of Religion__ <br/>
Research article submitted to the Cognitive Science Society conference (CogSci23). The article extends on the case-study reported in Poulsen and DeDeo (2023) and focuses on approaches cultural evolutionary questions.
