## Profile & Research
I apply cutting-edge computational and statistical models to understand complex phenomena. My work has touched on Agent-Based Models (ABMs), Bayesian modeling, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and social network analysis. Currently, I am working as a predoctoral fellow with prof. Simon DeDeo (CMU/SFI) on novel Machine Learning (ML) approaches to social and cultural data in the "small data" limit. 

## Education

`2020-2022`
__MSc, Cognitive Science, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
My Master's thesis used Bayesian modeling, network analysis, and NLP to understand the social dynamics of the replication crisis in psychological science. As part of my Master's studies I did an internship with prof. Roberta Sinatra at the NEtworKs, Data, and Society (NERDS) research group at the IT-University of Copenhagen (ITU) focusing on the impact of COVID-19 on scientific publishing. 

`2017-2020`
__BSc, Cognitive Science and Mathematics, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
My Bachelor's thesis implemented an ABM to investigate the role of scientific research strategies, diversity, and network connectivity in scientific discovery. I did my elective at the mathematics department to strengthen my quantitative profile. 

## Job Experience 

`2022-current` 
__Predoctoral Fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University__ <br/>
I am currently working with prof. Simon DeDeo (CMU/SFI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as a predoctoral researcher. Our research focuses on applying models from statistical physics (e.g. the Ising model) to develop novel ML approaches to social and cultural data. Through my position, I have been able to interact with world-class researchers in complexity science, and have I have presented our work to research groups at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI). 

`2020-2022`
__Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA)__ <br/>
My job as a student developer at CHCAA involved collaborating with researchers from the humanities to develop analysis pipelines, mostly focusing on NLP and social network analysis.

`2019-2020`
__Research Assistant at Music in the Brain (MiB)__ <br/>
My job as a research assistant at MiB involved conducting fMRI and MEG imaging, behavioural testing, data analysis, planning, and recruiting.  

## Technical Skills and Languages
* Danish, and English (excellent)
* Python, R, LaTeX, and GitHub (excellent) 
* Julia, Bash, and Inkscape (decent)

## Teaching Experience
`2020`
__Teaching Assistant for "Computational Modeling of Cognitive Science"__ <br/>
The Cognitive Science (BSc) course was taught by prof. Riccardo Fusaroli, and focused on applied Bayesian statistics in the R programming language. As a teaching assistant I helped the students with conceptual and technical questions related to weekly exercises. 

`2020`
__Teaching Assistant for "Experimental Methods 3"__ <br/>
The Cognitive Science (BSc) course was taught by prof. Byurakn Ishkhanyan and taught advanced frequentist statistics and ML in the R programming language. I was involved in preparing presentations for class exercises as well as helping students with weekly assignments. 

`2018`
__Teaching Assistant for "Studium Generale"__ <br/>
The Cognitive Science (BSc) course was taught by prof. Savhannah Schultz and focused on the history of Cognitive Science, and philosophy of science more broadly. In this course I prepared presentations, and facilitated discussions, exercises, and formal debates. 

## Publications

`2023` 
__Poulsen, V. M., & DeDeo, S. (2023). Inferring Cultural Landscapes with the Inverse Ising Model. Entropy, 25(2), 264.__ <br/> 
The article presents extensions and improvements to the Minimum Probability Flow (MPF) algorithm to approximate the inverse Ising model, and features a case-study on the Database of Religious History (DRH). 

__Cognitive Attractors and the Cultural Evolution of Religion (in review)__ <br/>
The article extends on the case-study reported in Poulsen and DeDeo (2023) and is currently in review for the CogSci23 conference.
