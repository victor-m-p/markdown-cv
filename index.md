## Profile & Research
I am broadly interseted in complexity science research, including social networks, cognitive science, and bayesian statistics. I am excited about diving into various fields and questions, and applying cutting-edge computational and statistical models to understand complex phenomena. I have worked on various approaches to statistical and computational modeling of social, cultural, and cognitive data. The work has included various methodologies, ranging from Agent-Based Models (ABMs), to Bayesian modeling, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and large-scale network analysis. Currently, I am working as a predoctoral fellow with prof. Simon DeDeo (CMU/SFI) on novel Machine Learning (ML) approaches to social and cultural data in the "small data" limit. 

## Education

`2020-2022`
__Cognitive Science MSc, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
In the 2020-2022 period I obtained a Cognitive Science (MSc) degree from Aarhus University (AU). My Master's thesis used Bayesian modeling, network analysis, and NLP to understand the social dynamics of the reform movement spurred by the replication crisis in psychological science. As part of my Master's studies I did an internship with prof. Roberta Sinatra at the NEtworKs, Data, and Society (NERDS) research group at the IT-University of Copenhagen (ITU). The work involved a big data investigation into the impact of COVID-19 on scientific publishing, my working focusing mostly on characterizing changes in the collaboration network centrality of various groups of researchers. 

`2017-2020`
__Cognitive Science BSc, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
In the 2017-2020 period I obtained a Cognitive Science (BSc) degree from Aarhus University (AU). My Bachelor's thesis implemented an ABM to investigate the role of scientific research strategies, diversity, and network connectivity in scientific discovery. As part of my Bachelor's studies I took electives at the mathematics department at Aarhus University (AU) to strenghten my quantitative profile. 

## Job Experience 

`2022-current` 
__Predoctoral Fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University (Simon DeDeo)__ <br/>
I am currently working with prof. Simon DeDeo (CMU/SFI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as a predoctoral researcher. Our research focuses on applying models from statistical physics (e.g. the Ising model) to develop novel ML approaches to social and cultural data. Through my position, I have been able to interact with world-class researchers in complexity science, and have I have presented our work to research groups at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI). 

`2020-2022`
__Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA)__ <br/>
In the 2020-2022 period I worked as a student programmer at the Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA). The job involved collaborating with researchers from the humanities to develop analysis pipelines, mostly focusing on NLP and social network analysis (e.g., https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/china-twitter).

`2019-2020`
__Research Assistant at Music in the Brain (MiB)__ <br/>
In the 2019-2020 period, I worked as a research assistant on a large-scale neuroimaging- and behavioural study focusing on the structural and functional changes in the brains of first-time parents. I conducted fMRI and MEG imaging, as well as behavioural testing, data analysis, planning, and recruiting. 

## Technical Skills and Languages
* Danish, and English (excellent)
* Python, R, LaTeX, and GitHub (excellent) 
* Julia, Bash, and Inkscape (decent)

## Teaching Experience
`2020`
__Teaching Assistant for "Computational Modeling of Cognitive Science"__ <br/>
Course was taught by prof. Riccardo Fusaroli at the Cognitive Science (BSc) program at Aarhus University. The course teaches applied Bayesian statistics in the R programming language, including multilevel modeling, MCMC sampling, entropy, and causality. In this course I mainly helped the students with conceptual and technical questions related to weekly exercises. 

`2020`
__Teaching Assistant for "Experimental Methods 3"__ <br/>
Course was taught by prof. Byurakn Ishkhanyan at the Cognitive Science (BSc) program at Aarhus University. The course teaches advanced frequentist statistics and ML in the R programming language. In this course I prepared presentations for class exercises, and helped students with both conceptual and technical questions related to weekly exercises. 

`2018`
__Teaching Assistant for "Studium Generale"__ <br/>
Course was taught by Savhannah Schultz at the Cognitive Science (BSc) program at Aarhus University. The focus is on the history of Cognitive Science as a discipline, and philosophy of science more broadly. In this course I prepared presentations, and facilitated discussions, exercises, and formal debates. 

## Publications

`2023` 
__Poulsen, V. M., & DeDeo, S. (2023). Inferring Cultural Landscapes with the Inverse Ising Model. Entropy, 25(2), 264.__ <br/> 
The article presents extensions and improvements to the Minimum Probability Flow (MPF) algorithm to approximate the inverse Ising model, and features a case-study on the Database of Religious History (DRH). 

__Cognitive Attractors and the Cultural Evolution of Religion (submitted to CogSci23)__ <br/>
The article extends on the case-study reported in Poulsen and DeDeo (2023) and is currently in review.
