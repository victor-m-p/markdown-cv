## Profile & Research
I am interseted in complexity science research, including social networks, cognitive science, and bayesian statistics. Currently, I am working as a predoctoral fellow with prof. Simon DeDeo (CMU/SFI) on novel Machine Learning (ML) approaches to social and cultural data in the "small data" limit. I 

Doing research at the intersection of Cognitive Science, Social Networks, Bayesian Statistics and Complexity Science. I have a solid theoretical and statistical understanding and strong coding skills in R, Python and bash scripting. I have worked with Roberta Sinatra (ITU) on science of science (internship), with Riccardo Fusaroli (AU) on the replication crisis and reform movement in psychology (Master's thesis). Currently working with Simon DeDeo (CMU) on culture and cognition using NLP, ML, and experimental approaches (predoctoral fellowship). 


## Education

`2020-2022`
__Cognitive Science MSc, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
Including internship at the NEtwoRks, Data, and Society (NERDS) research group at the IT-University of Copenhagen (ITU) working on science of science. In general focusing on Bayesian statistics, network science and NLP. 

`2017-2020`
__Cognitive Science BSc, Aarhus University (AU)__ <br/>
Including elective in mathematics at AU. The bachelor project was an Agent-Based Model (ABM) extending on "Scientific discovery in a model-centric framework: Reproducibility, innovation, and epistemic diversity" by Devezer et al. (2019). Learning statistics, social and cultural dynamics, cognition and language. 

## Job Experience 

`2022-current` 
__Predoctoral Fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University (Simon DeDeo)__ <br/>
I am currently working with prof. Simon DeDeo (CMU/SFI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as a predoctoral researcher. Our current research focuses on applying models from statistical physics (e.g. the Ising model) to develop novel Machine Learning (ML) approaches to social and cultural data. In particular, we have focused on developing improved tools to analyze small-scale data sets which are subject to biases, inconsistencies and missing data. Through my position, I have been able to interact with world-class researchers in complexity science, and have I have presented our work for research groups at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI). 

`2020-2022`
__Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA)__ <br/>
In the 2020-2022 period I worked as a student programmer at the Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA). The job involved collaborating with researchers from the humanities to develop analysis pipelines and conduct analyses. Most of the projects involved NLP and social network analysis (e.g. Twitter, Reddit, 4chan). A major project involved analyzing Chinese diplomats and state media on Twitter

`2019-2020`
__Research Assistant at Music in the Brain (MiB)__ <br/>
In the 2019-2020 period, I worked as a research assistant on a large-scale neuroimaging- and behavioural study focusing on the structural and functional changes in the brains of first-time parents. I conducted fMRI and MEG imaging on participants, as well as behavioural testing, data analysis, planning, and recruiting. 

## Technical Skills and Languages

* Python (excellent)
* R (excellent)
* GitHub (excellent)
* Julia (decent)
* Command line, bash scripting (decent)

## Teaching Experience
`2020`
__Teaching Assistant for "Computational Modeling of Cognitive Science"__ <br/>
I was a teaching assistent for prof. Riccardo Fusaroli on the course "Computational Modeling of Cognitive Science" in 2020 (fall semester). The course is taught for students at the Cognitive Science (BSc) program at Aarhus University. The focus of the course is on applied Bayesian statistics in the R programming language, and the course dives deep multilevel modeling, entropy, . In this course I mainly helped the students with conceptual and technical issues related to the weekly exercises. 

`2020`
__Teaching Assistant for "Experimental Methods 3"__ <br/>
I was a teaching assistant for prof. Byurakn Ishkhanyan on the course "Experimental Methods 3" in 2020 (spring semester). The course is taught for students at the Cognitive Science (BSc) program at Aarhus University. The course focuses on advanced frequentist statistics and Machine Learning (ML) in the R programming language. In this course I prepared presentations for class exercises, and helped students with both conceptual and technical issues.  

`2018`
__Teaching Assistant for "Studium Generale"__ <br/>
Teaching assistant for Savhannah Schulz on the course "Studium Generale" for students at the Cognitive Science (BSc) program at Aarhus University. The course focuses on the history of Cognitive Science as a discipline, and philosophy of science more broadly. The course covers the disciplines that are classically considered part of Cognitive Science, and how we define a scientific discipline and research program (incl. Popper, Lakatos, Kuhn, etc.). In this course I prepared presentations, and facilitated discussions, exercises, and formal debates.
